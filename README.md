## My Projects 

**Cryptocurrency - Finance And Banking Analysis**

Through this project, I mastered data analysis with Pandas in Python, focusing on cryptocurrencies and gaining skills applicable to finance and banking.

I explored Pandas Series and DataFrame fundamentals, covering indexing, sorting, selection, and manipulation. Advanced operations included filtering, cleaning, merging, encoding, scaling, slicing, concatenating, and multi-indexing. I also handled data exploration, group-by functionalities, date/time data, and text processing.

Additionally, I developed advanced data visualization techniques to create graphical representations of trends and insights.

**Finance With Power BI**

In my journey into financial data analysis and visualization with Power BI, I effectively utilized Power Query for data cleansing and preparation, ensuring data integrity. I established relationships between disparate data files, fostering cohesion across sources, and created reference tables for seamless visualization adjustments.

I designed a suite of visualizations with a focus on aesthetics and functionality, optimizing user experience and comprehension. Upon completion, I published the report for public access and exported it to PDF format for broad compatibility.

**Real Estate Price Prediction**

This project employs deep learning to predict home sale prices in King County, USA, from May 2014 to May 2015. Utilizing key features like bedrooms, bathrooms, views, and square footage, artificial neural networks achieve precise price predictions. 

Emphasizing foundational theories and practical applications of deep learning in real estate analysis, the project focuses on rigorous data visualization to elucidate relationships between property features and prices. 

Advanced data cleaning and feature engineering refine the dataset for optimal model training, aiming to capture intricate market patterns. Through detailed exploratory analysis, the project uncovers trends and correlations, enriching predictive accuracy and market understanding in King County real estate.

**Healthcare Decision Support System**

I meticulously corrected data errors, structured data for analysis, and uncovered insights for medical decision-making. Using advanced statistics, I translated findings into actionable reports for healthcare professionals. 

I employed bootstrapping to diversify data for model training, enhancing generalization. Leveraging the Perceptron algorithm, I optimized decision boundaries for effective class separation. Feature selection via Recursive Feature Elimination improved model accuracy and interpretability. 

This process ensured a robust healthcare decision support system delivering precise insights for enhanced patient care.

**Online School Call Sheet**

The Online School Call Sheet system utilizes HTML5, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, PHP (OOP) CRUD, SQL, and PDO to revolutionize attendance management in educational settings. It features secure user authentication, intuitive dashboards for attendance visibility, and robust class management tools. 

Real-time monitoring enhances accountability and fosters a structured learning environment. 

By automating attendance processes, the system reduces administrative burden, minimizes errors, and ensures compliance, supporting academic excellence and administrative efficiency.
